## :star2: About the Project
The Student Marking System consists of the main Marking Application as an Excel workbook, as well as the Student Database which will be used for input

## :book: How it Works
The Excel Marking Application opens to a home page where the user is instructed on how to begin the application. The user is then presented with three user forms:
- **File Selection:** The current directory is opened and the user is expected to select "Student Database.mdb".
- **Course Selection:** Next, the user is asked to select a course from the database.
- **Assignment Selection:** The final form asks the user to select an assignment from their chosen course.

After the user has made their selections, a new worksheet will generate displaying a table of the first names, last names, and student IDs of everyone enrolled in the course. Beside this the students grades for the chosen assignment will also be shown.

Some valuable statistics such as minimum, maximum, and average grades will also be shown. In addition to this, a histogram chart of all the grades will be developed. All of this information is simultaneously generated in a Microsoft Word report as well. The user may now choose to continue using the application, or save and quit.
